        This method can only be called after :meth:`load_laps` has been

        the optional ``with_telemetry=True`` argument instead of calling this
        method separately. The result will be the same.

        The raw data is divided into car data (Speed, RPM, ...) and position data (coordinates, on/off track). For each
        of the two types an instance of :class:`Telemetry` is created per driver. The properties
        :attr:`Session.car_data` and :attr:`Session.pos_data` are dictionaries which hold the the `Telemetry` objects
        keyed by driver number.

        The telemetry data can either be accessed through the above mentioned attributes or conveniently on a per
        lap basis through :class:`Lap` and :class:`Laps`. See :class:`Telemetry` on how to work with the telemetry
        data.

        Note that this method additionally calculates :attr:`Session.t0_date` and adds a `LapStartDate` column to
        :attr:`Session.laps`.

(def ^{:doc "Load session data from the supported APIs.

        This method allows to flexibly load some or all data that FastF1 can
        give you access to. Without specifying any further options, all data
        is loaded by default.

        Downloading and parsing of the data takes a considerable amount of
        time. Therefore, it is highly recommended to enable caching so that
        most of the data processing needs to be done only once.

        .. note:: **Lap data: drivers crashing and retiring**

            *During a session:*
            An additional last lap is added for a driver if the last timed
            lap of a driver is not an inlap and the session is aborted next.
            The `Time` for when this lap was \"set\" will be set to the time at
            which the session was aborted.

            *First lap in a race:*
            A single lap with minimal information will be added in race
            sessions if a driver does not complete at least one timed lap.
            The `LapStartTime` for this lap will be set to the start time
            of the session as with all other laps in a race. The `Time` at
            which this lap was \"set\" will be set to the time at which the
            first driver completes their first lap.


        .. note:: Absolute time is not super accurate. The moment a lap
            is logged is not always the same and there will be some
            jitter. At the moment lap time reference is synchronised
            on the sector time triggered with lowest latency.

            data of different laps.
